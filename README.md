# Get_next_line

The goal of this project is to write a function that reads a text file pointed to by the file descriptor and returns a single line. Repetead calls to the `get_next_line` function should read and return the entire text file, one line at a time.

## Key Concepts
- Memory management
- Static variables
- String manipulation

## How To Use
Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:Zveaga/Get_next_line.git
```
Move inside the Libft directory
```
cd Get_next_line
```
Compile
```
make
```
Now if you run `./get_next_line`, a test file will be displayed to the terminal. You can use any text file of your choosing, this one is just for the seeing the result of calling the get_next_line function multiple times to return the text file line by line. You could for example use the function in other C projects to read text files. Simply replace
